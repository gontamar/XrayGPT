https://www.anyscale.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-for-building-rag-based-llm-applications-part-1 analyze and study the content in this link

use this and what is implemented and developed in this blog

on similar lines look for github code base that uses a Vector Store to be used to store tokens- explore how this can be used for storing tokens,


 implement this for our system included in the repositrory of /home/test/Amit/RAG_LLM/Tokenization


implement previous created RAg for our system included in the repositrory of /home/test/Amit/RAG_LLM/Tokenization

we need to build a generic Multimodal AI framework for the following requirements 1)Data comes from any domains first will check it 
then apply some conditiong on that(like blank image not accepatable to learn and some text xxxx) based on domain data then feed to the
tokenizer for tokenization based on that data uses tokenizer 2)then feed to the encoder to generate the embeddings in this step first 
select the encoder in that which encoder uses to form embeddings all are set in config files 3)in this step apply self attension for 
what needs to focus to learn the model and cross attension between text and image features to form the final data 4)decode the 
response come from the cross attension to get readable text will be the response use xraygpt code as a reference but implement in 
generic for the following conditions mentioned above 


 study this directory files  and tell me how the flow is and how is it structured, analyze properly

 use this and propose a tokenization framework  which includes common stuff for tokenize logic and create a generic │
│ framework that applies to all domains Tokenizer logic, consider this xraygpt as reference█
